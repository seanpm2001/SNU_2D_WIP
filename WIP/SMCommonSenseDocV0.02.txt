killing people in real life is NOT OK
killing civilians is NOT ok
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
war
in war, both sides are figthing for something. War is bad
take this perspective: say you are fighting for your country, and you have to attack another country's soldiers. Those soldiers are doing just what you are doing.
Killing civilians in war is very bad, as they did nothing wrong. They got stuck in the situation.
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
weapons
weapons can be cruel
nuclear bombs don't solve problems, they may seem like a fix to a problem, but all it does is set us back. Nukes cause more problems than they solve
using chemical weapons is cruel
being cruel is bad

not all black people are criminals
not all asians eat dogs
not everyone in China works in a factory
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
appearance
you can't judge someone entirely by their appearance. Whether they are wearing a "dead meme" shirt, a fur fuit, baggy clothes, or other styles, you can't harass them over it unless it is extremely offensive
not all furries are bad, in fact most of them are nice decent caring people
just because someone dresses up in a fur suit doesn't mean that you have the right to shoot them
just because someone has a troll face shirt doesn't mean that they are bad
just because someone is poor, it doesn't mean they are a bad person. They just got unlucky. Go see them, unless they are unfriendly
just because someone is rich doesn't always mean that they are uncaring. Some rich people use their money to help the less fortunate. {they all should}
