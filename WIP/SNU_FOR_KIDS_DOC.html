<H1>SNU - For kids</H1>
<H2>Documentation</H2>
<p>You know how they say you shouldn't let the internet babysit your kids? Well they are right! You have to be there for your kids sometimes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all parents are able to be with their kids that frequently, and they have to rely on the internet to keep their children occupied.</p>
<p>These days, as soon as a baby comes out of the womb, he gets a tablet shoved into his face. We recommend waiting a while before doing that.</p>
<p>But the internet can be a very dangerous place for young kids. Take YouTube kids for example like all the clickbait videos about Johnny Johnny, Spiderman and Elsa, Finger puppets, and those other really creepy (and sometimes federally borderline illegal) videos. Most parents just let them watch it, not knowing what their kids are watching while they go off to work, meet with friends, or other activities.</p>
<p>SNU plans on changing that! Introducing the SNU kids mode. This mode allows you to set up a portion of your account to view certain approved content and lock it there. Videos are manually reviewed by teams of people. A single video will go through several people, and even the algorithm. You can choose the videos your children watch while you are away.</p>
<p>Please be sure to have this set up correctly. Choose as much content as possible, as your child may grow bored and not choose every video option.</p>
<p>Setting up your SNU account and personalizing it gives you loads of benefits, and we strongly suggest doing that.</p>
